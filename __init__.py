Package bpl.

Python module to work with bounded power-law (BPL) distributed random variables.

This module contains a few basic functions that help analyse power-law
distributed random variables that can be either bounded only from below or
from both above and below. It provides the following functions:

1.  Generate random samples from power-law distributed random variables.
2.  Estimate a logarithimically binned histogram for a power-law
    distributed random variable.
3.  Estimate the probability density function and the cumulative
    distribution function for specified power-law exponent.
